Neural-Symbolic AI: Achieving reasoning with artificial neural networks
======
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has found a great degree of success in recent decades, mostly due to the availability of vast amounts of data and processing power.

While AI models have shown incredible capabilities in processing data beyond what humans are capable, they still struggle to reliably show the same level of reasoning capabilities as humans.

Neural-Symbolic AI, i.e. the integration of artificial neural networks and symbolic reasoners, has led to the development of AI models that are capable of processing distributed data, while maintaining knowledge representation on the symbolic level.

Neural-Symbolic models have been shown to be more explainable, robust to noisy data, capable of generalizing beyond the training data, as well as learning from less data and using less processing power.

The key aspect of Neural-Symbolic AI that allows for these improvements in performance is the ability to not only learn from data, but also to reason about what has been learned.

Data Bites - Evening Talks
======
This series of talks by leading researchers and practitioners is organised by the City Enterprise team and Cityâ€™s Research Centre for Machine Learning in the Department of Computer Science. The talks have been running since 2014. It is designed to give students of Data Science and others access to first-hand information and experiences from industrial and other organisations, including well known names like Amazon, Thomson Reuters and the Home Office as well as smaller start-ups and consultancies. They all present their activities in the exciting field of data often with potential opportunities for placements and jobs.
